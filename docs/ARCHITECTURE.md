# Architecture: server, protocol and client networking

How the online game is put together. DESIGN 17 is the sketch; this file fixes the conventions the Phase 1 server and
networking tasks (P1.E02.T08, E03, E04, E06–E09) build on, so no task re-decides them. Where a task finds a convention
wrong, it changes this file in the same commit and logs the change in DECISIONS.md.

## 1. Packages and processes

| Package | Runs in | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `@astra/shared` | Node and the browser | deterministic world (`/world`), data tables (`/data`), protocol schemas and codecs (`/protocol`), combat math, glyphs (`/art`) |
| `@astra/server` | Node 22 under tsx | the gateway, zones, the world service, persistence |
| `@astra/client` | the browser | rendering, input, prediction, UI |
| `@astra/tools` | Node, Blender | gates, bots, smoke/e2e, capture, art export |

One server process in Phase 1 hosts the gateway, every zone and the world service; the code keeps them behind interfaces so
P3.E37 can split them across processes. Shared state that must survive a restart lives in Postgres; hot state that other
processes will read (presence, zone membership, the server clock) is mirrored to Redis.

## 2. Server layout (`packages/server/src`)

```
index.ts            boot: config → db → redis → world service → zone manager → gateway
config.ts           env (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT=8787, TICK_HZ=20), validated with zod
db/                 Drizzle schema (schema.ts), client, migrate.ts; SQL migrations in packages/server/drizzle/
gateway/http.ts     HTTP: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, GET /health, GET/POST /characters
gateway/ws.ts       WebSocket upgrade (token in the first message), one Session per socket
session/            Session: the account, the character in play, the zone it is in, its outbound queue
zones/              Zone (one star system), ZoneManager, spatial hash, interest sets, snapshot encoder
world/              WorldService: server clock, season, Count, Edge position, tier map
sim/                server-side systems added by later tasks: movement validation, combat, fauna, quests, skills…
dev/                dev-only login bypass and the admin CLI (P1.E03.T07)
```

Libraries: `fastify` for HTTP, `ws` for sockets (attached to Fastify's server in `noServer` mode), `drizzle-orm` with
`postgres` (postgres.js), `ioredis`, `@node-rs/argon2` for password hashes (argon2id, prebuilt binaries, no native build),
`jose` for JWTs (HS256, 7-day session tokens), `@msgpack/msgpack` for binary snapshots, `zod` for every message.

## 3. Time

The server owns the clock. World time `t` is seconds since the shard's epoch (stored in Postgres, so it survives restarts).
Every body pose comes from `t` (`bodyPose(spec, t)` in shared, P1.E02.T03), so client and server agree on where every planet
and station is without streaming them. The client keeps `game.time = serverTime + offset`, estimating the offset from the
`welcome` message and periodic `time` pings (half the round trip), and slews it rather than jumping.

## 4. Frames of reference on the wire

An entity's pose travels as `(frame, pos, quat, vel)` where `frame` is a **frame id**: a string naming the body in its system,
`"<systemSeed>:<bodyIndex>"` for planets and moons as `describeSystem` orders them, `"<systemSeed>:station"` for the
Waystation, or `null` for the system's inertial frame. Positions are float64 metres in the frame's local (rotating)
coordinates, exactly like the client's `FrameState`. The server changes an entity's frame with the same rule as
`FrameState.setFrame` (DESIGN 20.1 keeps frames of reference), so a pose re-expressed across a frame change keeps its world
position (P1.E03.T03 tests this to 1 cm).

## 5. Protocol (`@astra/shared/protocol`)

- **Control messages are JSON**, one object per WebSocket text frame, shaped `{ "t": "<type>", ... }` and validated with a
  zod discriminated union on both ends. Decoding never throws: unknown or invalid messages are dropped and counted.
  Encoding validates and throws `InvalidMessageError`, so a NaN or out-of-range field fails at the sender instead of
  arriving as `null`.
- **Client → server schemas are the trust boundary:** every string has a length cap (ids 64, tokens 4096, chat 280 without
  control or bidi-override characters), positions and velocities are finite and bounded, quaternions must be unit length,
  directions non-zero, frame ids `\d{1,10}:(\d{1,3}|station)`, the button mask 8 bits.
- **Snapshots are binary**: a WebSocket binary frame whose first byte is the message kind and whose rest is msgpack
  (float64 numbers). Kind `1` is a zone snapshot `{ tick, time, ack, full, base?, entities, removed }`. A delta names its
  baseline `base`, the tick of the snapshot the client last acknowledged; the client keeps the states it was sent per tick,
  applies the delta onto `base` and stores the result as `tick`. An entity delta carries its changed fields and `clear`, the
  fields it no longer has. `ack` echoes the client's last applied input `seq` for reconciliation. The server diffs against
  the state it last *sent*, not its true state, so slow motion under the epsilon still goes out. The encoder sends only the
  listed fields, validates each against its schema, clamps unit fields, and drops and reports any field that fails, so a
  client never rejects what the server sent. The decoder still drops a malformed entity on its own; a client that sees
  one must not store or acknowledge that tick. Control-message encoders send the validated copy, so keys a schema does
  not define (server-only state on a wider object) never leave the server.
- **Versioning:** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in shared; the client sends it in `hello`, whose shape is frozen across versions;
  the server reads it with `peekVersion` before full validation and refuses a mismatch with `refused {code: 'version'}`.
- **Client → server:** `hello {version, token}`, `join {characterId}`, `input {seq, time, mode, pose: {frame, pos, quat,
  vel}, buttons, aim?}` at 20 Hz (`time` because `t` is the type tag; the server measures elapsed time itself and never
  trusts `time` for speed checks; `mode` is a prediction validated like the pose), `cast {seq, slot, aim, target?}`,
  `interact {target}`, `chat {channel, text}`, `ack {tick}`, `ping {id, clientTime}`, `inventory {seq, op}`.
- **Server → client:** `welcome {accountId, character, entityId, serverTime, zone, pose, mode}`, `refused {code, reason}`,
  `correction {seq, pose, mode}`, `zone {zone, pose}` (handoff), `event {event}` with kinds `combat`, `quest`, `chat`,
  `loot` and `notice` (toasts), `world {season, count, edgeX, tiers, serverTime}`, `pong`, `inventory {seq, inventory,
  error?}`, and snapshots.
- **Inventory** (`@astra/shared/inventory`, protocol 2): the value is `{stackMax, units, suit, pods}`, the suit's slots and
  each cargo pod's slots holding `{item, count}` stacks or null; only resources, items and units, never fragments, skill
  points or reputation (the schema is strict). A client asks only for stack moves: `op` is `move {from, to, count?}`,
  `split {from, count, to?}`, `merge {from, to}`, `transfer {from, count?}` (across to the other side) or `compact {c}`,
  with slots `{c: 'suit', i}` or `{c: 'pod', p, i}` bounded to 64 suit slots, 32 pods and 64 slots a pod. `seq` counts the
  session's requests from 1 and must increase. The client applies the same shared op at once to predict; the server
  applies it through the inventory service and answers every request with `inventory` state, where `seq` is the last
  request it handled this session and `error` the code it refused that one with (`stale_seq` for a replayed number).
  The server also sends the state after `welcome` (`seq` 0) and pushes it whenever server-side systems change it (loot,
  mining, trade, the Recall's cargo drop); the client keeps its unanswered requests and replays those above `seq` on
  top, drops any left unanswered for 5 s (the gateway drops an over-budget message without a reply), never sends an op
  that fails the schema, and starts over (no pending requests, `seq` from 1) on the state sent after `welcome`. The pods
  are the ship's: one per pod its `ShipLoadout` carries, checked against the bays `shipStats` gives (P1.E12.T01).
  Adding, taking and units are never requests. `inventory` is the one type both directions use; `encodeMessage`
  picks the union whose schema accepts the message.
- **HTTP bodies** use the same module: `Credentials`, `AuthResponse`, `CharacterCreate`, `CharacterSummary`,
  `CharacterList`.

## 6. Zones

A zone hosts one star system: every entity in it, a 20 Hz tick, a spatial hash over world positions at the tick's time,
interest sets per session (entities within the class radius of the session's own entity: ships 50 km, walkers 2 km, mobs
1.5 km, loot 500 m, always the session's party), and per-session delta snapshots. Ticks are fixed-step; a tick that overruns
is logged with its duration (the budget is 10 ms p95 at 200 entities). Entities in deep space between systems belong to a
deep-space zone keyed by the nearest system (P1.E04.T04).

## 7. Authority

Following IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN 0.3: the client sends inputs and its predicted pose; the server validates pose against per-hull
and walker speed caps and the shared terrain sampler, corrects with `correction` when the error exceeds tolerance, and
decides damage, loot, inventory, quests, economy, skills and the meter. Client-reported outcomes (damage dealt, items
picked up, quest steps done) are never trusted; they are requests the server re-evaluates.

## 8. Persistence

Postgres tables (Drizzle): `accounts`, `characters` (people, name, look, level, xp, home system, pose, frame, ship), and
JSON-typed columns or child tables for inventory, skills, quests and flags as the tasks that own them arrive. Characters
persist every 30 s and on logout (P1.E03.T05). Migrations are generated with drizzle-kit and applied with `pnpm db:migrate`.

## 9. Client networking (`packages/client/src/net`)

`Net` owns the socket: connect, `hello`, `join`, the clock offset, decoding snapshots into an entity store, sending input at
20 Hz, and applying `correction`s through the prediction layer. Remote entities render from the store with 100 ms
interpolation delay and up to 250 ms extrapolation, frame-aware (interpolate in the entity's frame; on a frame change,
re-express the buffered poses). Gameplay code reads remote state from the store, never from the socket.

## 10. Tests

Unit tests (`*.test.ts`) next to the code or in the package's `test/` folder; integration tests (`*.int.test.ts`) start a real server on a random port against
the dockerised Postgres and Redis (`pnpm db:up && pnpm test:int`) and drive it with scripted clients from
`packages/tools/src/bots`. Each integration test creates its own accounts with unique names and cleans nothing up; the
database is disposable.
