# Architecture: server, protocol and client networking

How the online game is put together. DESIGN 17 is the sketch; this file fixes the conventions the Phase 1 server and
networking tasks (P1.E02.T08, E03, E04, E06–E09) build on, so no task re-decides them. Where a task finds a convention
wrong, it changes this file in the same commit and logs the change in DECISIONS.md.

## 1. Packages and processes

| Package | Runs in | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `@astra/shared` | Node and the browser | deterministic world (`/world`), data tables (`/data`), protocol schemas and codecs (`/protocol`), combat math, glyphs (`/art`) |
| `@astra/server` | Node 22 under tsx | the gateway, zones, the world service, persistence |
| `@astra/client` | the browser | rendering, input, prediction, UI |
| `@astra/tools` | Node, Blender | gates, bots, smoke/e2e, capture, art export |

One server process in Phase 1 hosts the gateway, every zone and the world service; the code keeps them behind interfaces so
P3.E37 can split them across processes. Shared state that must survive a restart lives in Postgres; hot state that other
processes will read (presence, zone membership, the server clock) is mirrored to Redis.

## 2. Server layout (`packages/server/src`)

```
index.ts            boot: config → db → redis → world service → zone manager → gateway
config.ts           env (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT=8787, TICK_HZ=20), validated with zod
db/                 Drizzle schema (schema.ts), client, migrate.ts; SQL migrations in packages/server/drizzle/
gateway/http.ts     HTTP: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, GET /health, GET/POST /characters
gateway/ws.ts       WebSocket upgrade (token in the first message), one Session per socket
session/            Session: the account, the character in play, the zone it is in, its outbound queue
zones/              Zone (one star system), ZoneManager, spatial hash, interest sets, snapshot encoder
world/              WorldService: server clock, season, Count, Edge position, tier map
sim/                server-side systems added by later tasks: movement validation, combat, fauna, quests, skills…
dev/                dev-only login bypass and the admin CLI (P1.E03.T07)
```

Libraries: `fastify` for HTTP, `ws` for sockets (attached to Fastify's server in `noServer` mode), `drizzle-orm` with
`postgres` (postgres.js), `ioredis`, `@node-rs/argon2` for password hashes (argon2id, prebuilt binaries, no native build),
`jose` for JWTs (HS256, 7-day session tokens), `@msgpack/msgpack` for binary snapshots, `zod` for every message.

## 3. Time

The server owns the clock. World time `t` is seconds since the shard's epoch (stored in Postgres, so it survives restarts).
Every body pose comes from `t` (`bodyPose(spec, t)` in shared, P1.E02.T03), so client and server agree on where every planet
and station is without streaming them. The client keeps `game.time = serverTime + offset`, estimating the offset from the
`welcome` message and periodic `time` pings (half the round trip), and slews it rather than jumping.

## 4. Frames of reference on the wire

An entity's pose travels as `(frame, pos, quat, vel)` where `frame` is a **frame id**: a string naming the body in its system,
`"<systemSeed>:<bodyIndex>"` for planets and moons as `describeSystem` orders them, `"<systemSeed>:station"` for the
Waystation, or `null` for the system's inertial frame. Positions are float64 metres in the frame's local (rotating)
coordinates, exactly like the client's `FrameState`. The server changes an entity's frame with the same rule as
`FrameState.setFrame` (DESIGN 20.1 keeps frames of reference), so a pose re-expressed across a frame change keeps its world
position (P1.E03.T03 tests this to 1 cm).

## 5. Protocol (`@astra/shared/protocol`)

- **Control messages are JSON**, one object per WebSocket text frame, shaped `{ "t": "<type>", ... }` and validated with a
  zod discriminated union on both ends. Decoding never throws: unknown or invalid messages are dropped and counted.
  Encoding validates and throws `InvalidMessageError`, so a NaN or out-of-range field fails at the sender instead of
  arriving as `null`.
- **Client → server schemas are the trust boundary:** every string has a length cap (ids 64, tokens 4096, chat 280 without
  control or bidi-override characters), positions and velocities are finite and bounded, quaternions must be unit length,
  directions non-zero, frame ids `\d{1,10}:(\d{1,3}|station)`, the button mask 8 bits.
- **Snapshots are binary**: a WebSocket binary frame whose first byte is the message kind and whose rest is msgpack
  (float64 numbers). Kind `1` is a zone snapshot `{ tick, time, ack, full, base?, entities, removed }`. A delta names its
  baseline `base`, the tick of the snapshot the client last acknowledged; the client keeps the states it was sent per tick,
  applies the delta onto `base` and stores the result as `tick`. An entity delta carries its changed fields and `clear`, the
  fields it no longer has. `ack` echoes the client's last applied input `seq` for reconciliation. The server diffs against
  the state it last *sent*, not its true state, so slow motion under the epsilon still goes out. The encoder clamps unit
  fields and drops non-finite fields; the decoder drops a malformed entity on its own and keeps the rest of the frame.
- **Versioning:** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in shared; the client sends it in `hello`, whose shape is frozen across versions;
  the server reads it with `peekVersion` before full validation and refuses a mismatch with `refused {code: 'version'}`.
- **Client → server:** `hello {version, token}`, `join {characterId}`, `input {seq, time, mode, pose: {frame, pos, quat,
  vel}, buttons, aim?}` at 20 Hz (`time` because `t` is the type tag; the server measures elapsed time itself and never
  trusts `time` for speed checks; `mode` is a prediction validated like the pose), `cast {seq, slot, aim, target?}`,
  `interact {target}`, `chat {channel, text}`, `ack {tick}`, `ping {id, clientTime}`.
- **Server → client:** `welcome {accountId, character, entityId, serverTime, zone, pose, mode}`, `refused {code, reason}`,
  `correction {seq, pose, mode}`, `zone {zone, pose}` (handoff), `event {event}` with kinds `combat`, `quest`, `chat`,
  `loot` and `notice` (toasts), `world {season, count, edgeX, tiers, serverTime}`, `pong`, and snapshots.
- **HTTP bodies** use the same module: `Credentials`, `AuthResponse`, `CharacterCreate`, `CharacterSummary`,
  `CharacterList`.

## 6. Zones

A zone hosts one star system: every entity in it, a 20 Hz tick, a spatial hash over world positions at the tick's time,
interest sets per session (entities within the class radius of the session's own entity: ships 50 km, walkers 2 km, mobs
1.5 km, loot 500 m, always the session's party), and per-session delta snapshots. Ticks are fixed-step; a tick that overruns
is logged with its duration (the budget is 10 ms p95 at 200 entities). Entities in deep space between systems belong to a
deep-space zone keyed by the nearest system (P1.E04.T04).

## 7. Authority

Following IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN 0.3: the client sends inputs and its predicted pose; the server validates pose against per-hull
and walker speed caps and the shared terrain sampler, corrects with `correction` when the error exceeds tolerance, and
decides damage, loot, inventory, quests, economy, skills and the meter. Client-reported outcomes (damage dealt, items
picked up, quest steps done) are never trusted; they are requests the server re-evaluates.

## 8. Persistence

Postgres tables (Drizzle): `accounts`, `characters` (people, name, look, level, xp, home system, pose, frame, ship), and
JSON-typed columns or child tables for inventory, skills, quests and flags as the tasks that own them arrive. Characters
persist every 30 s and on logout (P1.E03.T05). Migrations are generated with drizzle-kit and applied with `pnpm db:migrate`.

## 9. Client networking (`packages/client/src/net`)

`Net` owns the socket: connect, `hello`, `join`, the clock offset, decoding snapshots into an entity store, sending input at
20 Hz, and applying `correction`s through the prediction layer. Remote entities render from the store with 100 ms
interpolation delay and up to 250 ms extrapolation, frame-aware (interpolate in the entity's frame; on a frame change,
re-express the buffered poses). Gameplay code reads remote state from the store, never from the socket.

## 10. Tests

Unit tests (`*.test.ts`) next to the code or in the package's `test/` folder; integration tests (`*.int.test.ts`) start a real server on a random port against
the dockerised Postgres and Redis (`pnpm db:up && pnpm test:int`) and drive it with scripted clients from
`packages/tools/src/bots`. Each integration test creates its own accounts with unique names and cleans nothing up; the
database is disposable.
