# Architecture: server, protocol and client networking

How the online game is put together. DESIGN 17 is the sketch; this file fixes the conventions the Phase 1 server and
networking tasks (P1.E02.T08, E03, E04, E06–E09) build on, so no task re-decides them. Where a task finds a convention
wrong, it changes this file in the same commit and logs the change in DECISIONS.md.

## 1. Packages and processes

| Package | Runs in | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `@astra/shared` | Node and the browser | deterministic world (`/world`), data tables (`/data`), protocol schemas and codecs (`/protocol`), combat math, glyphs (`/art`) |
| `@astra/server` | Node 22 under tsx | the gateway, zones, the world service, persistence |
| `@astra/client` | the browser | rendering, input, prediction, UI |
| `@astra/tools` | Node, Blender | gates, bots, smoke/e2e, capture, art export |

One server process in Phase 1 hosts the gateway, every zone and the world service; the code keeps them behind interfaces so
P3.E37 can split them across processes. Shared state that must survive a restart lives in Postgres; hot state that other
processes will read (presence, zone membership, the server clock) is mirrored to Redis.

## 2. Server layout (`packages/server/src`)

```
index.ts            boot: config → db → redis → world service → zone manager → gateway
config.ts           env (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, PORT=8787, TICK_HZ=20), validated with zod
db/                 Drizzle schema (schema.ts), client, migrate.ts; SQL migrations in packages/server/drizzle/
gateway/http.ts     HTTP: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login, GET /health, GET/POST /characters
gateway/ws.ts       WebSocket upgrade (token in the first message), one Session per socket
session/            Session: the account, the character in play, the zone it is in, its outbound queue
zones/              Zone (one star system), ZoneManager, spatial hash, interest sets, snapshot encoder
phases/             PhaseManager (one per zone): private layers at shared places, their caps and visibility rule
world/              WorldService: server clock, season, Count, Edge position, tier map
count/              the Count meter (§11): lean, target, drift, burn and underdog arithmetic; the day ledger; its store
sim/                server-side systems added by later tasks: movement validation, combat, fauna, quests, skills…
dev/                dev-only login bypass and the admin CLI (P1.E03.T07)
```

Libraries: `fastify` for HTTP, `ws` for sockets (attached to Fastify's server in `noServer` mode), `drizzle-orm` with
`postgres` (postgres.js), `ioredis`, `@node-rs/argon2` for password hashes (argon2id, prebuilt binaries, no native build),
`jose` for JWTs (HS256, 7-day session tokens), `@msgpack/msgpack` for binary snapshots, `zod` for every message.

## 3. Time

The server owns the clock. World time `t` is seconds since the shard's epoch (stored in Postgres, so it survives restarts).
Every body pose comes from `t` (`bodyPose(spec, t)` in shared, P1.E02.T03), so client and server agree on where every planet
and station is without streaming them. The client keeps `game.time = serverTime + offset`, estimating the offset from the
`welcome` message and periodic `ping`/`pong` round trips (half the round trip), and slews it rather than jumping. The
server pushes no periodic time of its own: a pong is the better sample because the client can halve its round trip, and
`world` carries a `serverTime` too.

The shard's row (`shards`, created on the shard's first boot) holds its epoch (2026-01-01Z for a new shard), its season
(number, start in world time, length; DESIGN 16.4) and `last_time`, the latest world time its server saved (every minute and
on shutdown). At boot the world service (`world/service.ts`) starts the clock at the wall time since the epoch, but never
below `last_time`, and advances it with the monotonic clock; so `t` carries on across a restart and never steps backwards,
even when the host's wall clock has. The world service mirrors its state to Redis under `astra:shard:<id>:world` (JSON,
with a clock sync point `{time, at}`: world time `time` at wall time `at` ms) for the processes P3.E37 splits off.

## 4. Frames of reference on the wire

An entity's pose travels as `(frame, pos, quat, vel)` where `frame` is a **frame id**: a string naming the body in its system,
`"<systemSeed>:<bodyIndex>"` for planets and moons as `describeSystem` orders them, `"<systemSeed>:station"` for the
Waystation, or `null` for the system's inertial frame. Positions are float64 metres in the frame's local (rotating)
coordinates, exactly like the client's `FrameState`. The server changes an entity's frame with the same rule as
`FrameState.setFrame` (DESIGN 20.1 keeps frames of reference), so a pose re-expressed across a frame change keeps its world
position (P1.E03.T03 tests this to 1 cm).

Which frame an entity belongs in is one rule, `selectFrame` in `@astra/shared/world` (`frames.ts`), which the client's
`Game.chooseFrame` and the server's zones both call: inside the Waystation's sphere of influence, the Waystation's frame;
else the planet or moon with the smallest sphere that holds it; else the inertial frame. An entity stays in its frame until
it is 5% beyond that frame's sphere (`FRAME_HYSTERESIS`), unless a smaller sphere inside it holds the entity (the
Waystation's in its world's, a moon's in its planet's). Every tick a zone takes each entity's world position at the tick's
time, picks its frame by this rule and, when it changed, re-expresses its pose with `setFrame` (velocity turned, never
boosted), so its next snapshot carries the new frame id. A client sending its pose in the frame it picked by the same rule
is never re-expressed but at the edge of a sphere, where its clock and the tick's differ. `frames.ts` also converts between
wire poses and the kinematics' shapes (`frameKeyOf`/`frameIdOf`, `framePose`, `reframe`, `settleFrame`, `localPoseInto`/
`framedPose` for the client's `FrameState`).

## 5. Protocol (`@astra/shared/protocol`)

- **Control messages are JSON**, one object per WebSocket text frame, shaped `{ "t": "<type>", ... }` and validated with a
  zod discriminated union on both ends. Decoding never throws: unknown or invalid messages are dropped and counted.
  Encoding validates and throws `InvalidMessageError`, so a NaN or out-of-range field fails at the sender instead of
  arriving as `null`.
- **Client → server schemas are the trust boundary:** every string has a length cap (ids 64, tokens 4096, chat 280 without
  control or bidi-override characters), positions and velocities are finite and bounded, quaternions must be unit length,
  directions non-zero, frame ids `\d{1,10}:(\d{1,3}|station)`, the button mask 8 bits.
- **Snapshots are binary**: a WebSocket binary frame whose first byte is the message kind and whose rest is msgpack
  (float64 numbers). Kind `1` is a zone snapshot `{ tick, time, ack, full, base?, entities, removed }`. A delta names its
  baseline `base`, the tick of the snapshot the client last acknowledged; the client keeps the states it was sent per tick,
  applies the delta onto `base` and stores the result as `tick`. An entity delta carries its changed fields and `clear`, the
  fields it no longer has. `ack` echoes the client's last applied input `seq` for reconciliation; clients number inputs
  from 1, so `ack` 0 means no input applied yet. The client acknowledges each snapshot it applies with `ack {tick}`, at
  most once per tick; the server diffs against the latest acknowledged tick it still holds (64 ticks, about 3 s) and
  sends a full snapshot when it holds none. The server diffs against the state it last *sent*, not its true state, so
  slow motion under the epsilon still goes out. The encoder sends only the listed fields, validates each against its
  schema, clamps unit fields, and drops and reports any field that fails, so a client never rejects what the server sent. The decoder still drops a malformed entity on its own; a client that sees
  one must not store or acknowledge that tick. Control-message encoders send the validated copy, so keys a schema does
  not define (server-only state on a wider object) never leave the server.
- **Versioning:** `PROTOCOL_VERSION` in shared; the client sends it in `hello`, whose shape is frozen across versions;
  the server reads it with `peekVersion` before full validation and refuses a mismatch with `refused {code: 'version'}`.
- **Client → server:** `hello {version, token}`, `join {characterId}`, `input {seq, time, mode, pose: {frame, pos, quat,
  vel}, buttons, aim?}` at 20 Hz (`time` because `t` is the type tag; the server measures elapsed time itself and never
  trusts `time` for speed checks; `mode` is a prediction validated like the pose; `seq` counts from 1),
  `cast {seq, slot, aim, target?}`, `interact {target}`, `chat {channel, text}`, `ack {tick}` (one per applied snapshot,
  at most once per tick), `ping {id, clientTime}`, `inventory {seq, op}`. Each socket's message budget is 60 a second
  with a burst of 120: input and acks take 40, leaving room for pings, casts, interactions, chat and inventory requests,
  and the burst absorbs the backlog of a stall.
- **Server → client:** `welcome {accountId, character, entityId, serverTime, zone, pose, mode}`, `refused {code, reason}`,
  `correction {seq, pose, mode}`, `zone {zone, pose}` (handoff), `event {event}` with kinds `combat`, `quest`, `chat`,
  `loot` and `notice` (toasts), `world {season, count, edgeX, tiers, serverTime}` (sent right after `welcome` and to every
  joined session whenever the world service's state changes; `tiers` is each galaxy system's tier by index), `pong`,
  `inventory {seq, inventory, error?}`, and snapshots.
- **Inventory** (`@astra/shared/inventory`, protocol 2): the value is `{stackMax, units, suit, pods}`, the suit's slots and
  each cargo pod's slots holding `{item, count}` stacks or null; only resources, items and units, never fragments, skill
  points or reputation (the schema is strict). A client asks only for stack moves: `op` is `move {from, to, count?}`,
  `split {from, count, to?}`, `merge {from, to}`, `transfer {from, count?}` (across to the other side) or `compact {c}`,
  with slots `{c: 'suit', i}` or `{c: 'pod', p, i}` bounded to 64 suit slots, 32 pods and 64 slots a pod. `seq` counts the
  session's requests from 1 and must increase. The client applies the same shared op at once to predict; the server
  applies it through the inventory service and answers every request with `inventory` state, where `seq` is the last
  request it handled this session and `error` the code it refused that one with (`stale_seq` for a replayed number).
  The server also sends the state after `welcome` (`seq` 0) and pushes it whenever server-side systems change it (loot,
  mining, trade, the Recall's cargo drop); the client keeps its unanswered requests and replays those above `seq` on
  top, drops any left unanswered for 5 s (the gateway drops an over-budget message without a reply), never sends an op
  that fails the schema, and starts over (no pending requests, `seq` from 1) on the state sent after `welcome`. The pods
  are the ship's: one per pod its `ShipLoadout` carries, checked against the bays `shipStats` gives (P1.E12.T01).
  Adding, taking and units are never requests. `inventory` is the one type both directions use; `encodeMessage`
  picks the union whose schema accepts the message.
- **HTTP bodies** use the same module: `Credentials`, `AuthResponse`, `CharacterCreate`, `CharacterSummary`,
  `CharacterList`.

## 6. Zones

A zone hosts one star system: every entity in it, a 20 Hz tick, a spatial hash over world positions at the tick's time,
interest sets per session (entities within the class radius of the session's own entity: ships 50 km, walkers 2 km, mobs
1.5 km, loot 500 m; always the session's own entity, and its party wherever they are; then its phase may hide some of
them, §6.1), and per-session delta snapshots. Ticks are fixed-step; a tick that overruns is logged with its duration (the
budget is 10 ms p95 at 200 entities). Entities in deep space between systems belong to a deep-space zone keyed by the
nearest system (P1.E04.T04).

The radius is the class of the entity seen, not of the viewer: a ship, or a player in any mode but `foot` (docked and
landed players sit in their ships), is a ship; a player on foot, an NPC or a prop is a walker; a mob is a mob; loot and
loot pods are loot. An entity already in view stays in it until it is 5% beyond its radius, so one at the edge does not
enter and leave every tick. Until movement authority (P1.E03.T04) validates `mode`, a client picks its own class through
it. A zone opens on its first join, stops ticking after 30 s empty and unloads after 5 minutes empty.

### 6.1 Phases

DESIGN 17's phases (story chapters and instanced quest steps, hangar bays, event and raid instances) are private layers
inside a zone, kept by its `PhaseManager` (`zone.phases`, `phases/manager.ts`). A phase is opened at a **location**: a key
naming the place (a quest step's site, a Waystation's hangar) and a sphere in one of the system's frames, which moves with
the frame. Every entity is in one phase or none (the shared world): **members** are sessions' players, placed by
`phaseFor(session, kind, location, partyId?)`; a phase's **own entities** (its actors) are spawned through `spawn(phase,
init)`. Kinds and caps (`phases/kinds.ts`): `story` holds one party (a player in no party is a party of one), `bay` 24
players, `event` and `raid` 12.

- **Placement** reuses the phase the player is already in at that place (or kept for its character, below), else a
  party member's that has room, else the fullest that has room (the oldest of equals), else opens one. A player is in one
  phase at a time; placing it elsewhere takes it out of the old one. A member's party is the `partyId` it was placed
  under, which it keeps; without one, its entity's party tag as it stands (the tag stands in for the party system,
  P1.E15.T01). A story phase never holds two parties: re-asked, or coming back, under a party its others are not in, a
  player goes to another phase.
- **Visibility** filters every interest set after the distance and party rules (the phase rule wins over the party
  rule): a session sees the shared world and its own phase; never another phase's own entities; and another phase's
  players unless either is **sealed**, a member inside its phase's volume (5% hysteresis) in a kind that isolates
  players (`bay`, `event`, `raid`). A sealed member sees no player outside its phase, the shared world's included, and
  none sees it; the shared world's other entities stay in its sight. A `story` phase hides only its actors (DESIGN 14.1:
  everyone else sees the ordinary world there). With nothing in a phase the filter is skipped.
- **Presence**: a member outside the volume goes back to the shared world after the kind's grace (15 s), keeping its
  phase if it returns in time. A member whose connection drops (`ZoneManager.leave(session, 'disconnected')`: every
  socket close, and the old connection kicked when its character enters again) keeps its place for the same grace, by
  character id, with its party, counting towards the cap; its character's next `phaseFor` at that place returns it to
  the phase. A member already outside the volume keeps only what is left of its grace, and comes back still outside, so
  dropping and reconnecting never extends it. One that leaves the zone any other way (a handoff, a logout) goes at once. A phase with no members and no
  kept places closes, and its own entities are despawned; `close(phase)` does the same on demand. Opening and closing
  are logged (info).

## 7. Authority

Following IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN 0.3: the client sends inputs and its predicted pose; the server validates pose against per-hull
and walker speed caps and the shared terrain sampler, corrects with `correction` when the error exceeds tolerance, and
decides damage, loot, inventory, quests, economy, skills and the meter. Client-reported outcomes (damage dealt, items
picked up, quest steps done) are never trusted; they are requests the server re-evaluates.

## 8. Persistence

Postgres tables (Drizzle): `accounts`, `characters` (people, name, look, level, xp, home system, pose, frame, ship), and
JSON-typed columns or child tables for inventory, skills, quests and flags as the tasks that own them arrive. Characters
persist every 30 s and on logout (P1.E03.T05). The shard's row (§3) also holds the Count; the meter's votes and daily
rolls are in `count_votes` and `count_days` (§11). Migrations are generated with drizzle-kit and applied with
`pnpm db:migrate`.

## 9. Client networking (`packages/client/src/net`)

`Net` owns the socket: connect, `hello`, `join`, the clock offset, decoding snapshots into an entity store, sending input at
20 Hz, and applying `correction`s through the prediction layer. Remote entities render from the store with 100 ms
interpolation delay and up to 250 ms extrapolation, frame-aware (interpolate in the entity's frame; on a frame change,
re-express the buffered poses). Gameplay code reads remote state from the store, never from the socket.

## 10. Tests

Unit tests (`*.test.ts`) next to the code or in the package's `test/` folder; integration tests (`*.int.test.ts`) start a real server on a random port against
the dockerised Postgres and Redis (`pnpm db:up && pnpm test:int`) and drive it with scripted clients from
`packages/tools/src/bots`. Each integration test creates its own accounts with unique names and cleans nothing up; the
database is disposable.

## 11. The Count meter (`packages/server/src/count`)

DESIGN 16.2, lean not volume. Gameplay reports each counted action to the world service with
`world.countAction(accountId, action, tag)`: `action` is one of `COUNTED_ACTIONS` in `count/meter.ts` (convoy escorted or
raided, the wall choice, an anchor held, a Hive Heart shattered, a Warden killed, a monolith touched), `tag` is `feed`,
`hold` or `break`. The open day's ledger keeps one vote per account per action type (the first cast; the call returns
false for a repeat) and saves each vote to `count_votes`. A meter day is 86,400 s of shard-clock world time from the epoch
(§3), never wall time. When the clock crosses into a new day (checked every second, and before every counted action) the
ended day rolls: the lean is Feed's share of the day's vote weight (Hold gives a third of a Feed; a monolith touch weighs a
tenth of a vote), the target is `round(150 + 700 × lean)`, the Count drifts toward it by at most 25 and burns 5, and stays
in whole measures in 0–1,000; a day with no votes only burns. The roll is written to `count_days` and the shard's row
(`count`, `count_day`) in one transaction, published as an ordinary world change (`world` to clients, the Redis mirror),
and logged. On boot the service reloads the votes of every day after `count_day`, rolls the days that ended while it was
down, and takes the open day's ledger back, so a restart keeps the day's votes and its one-vote rule; the clock never starts
below a stored vote's time. The underdog side (`underdogSide(count)`: Break above 700, Feed below 300) and its rep
multiplier (`underdogRepMultiplier(count, tag)`, 1.5, Hold included on either side) are pure functions for the rep model
to apply. All the arithmetic is pure and integer-exact (votes are summed in thirtieths), so the same lean gives the same
drift bit for bit at three accounts and at three thousand.
